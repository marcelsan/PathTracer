# PathTracer

This project was fully written in C++11 late 2015 to Graphics Computer course at CIn UFPE. It is my first implementation of the Path Tracing global ilumination algorithm.

### Features ###

1. Scene loader (the user can set the camera position, the objects positions and materials, lights etc.)
2. .OBJ file loader
3. Anti-aliasing
4. Recursive refraction using Snell's Law
5. Recursive reflection
6. Reflectance and trasmittance following Fresnel's equations

So far, it is only possible to use Phong materials
